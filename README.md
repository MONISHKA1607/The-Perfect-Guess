# The-Perfect-Guess
This is a simple Python-based number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides hints to guide the player towards the correct guess.


How It Works

The program randomly generates a number between 1 and 100 using Python's random module.

The player inputs guesses, and the program provides feedback:

"Lower number please" if the guess is too high.

"Higher number please" if the guess is too low.

The game continues until the player guesses the correct number, at which point the program displays the number of attempts taken.

Features:

Randomized number generation ensures replayability.

User-friendly feedback for each guess.

Tracks the number of attempts to encourage competitive play

Example Gameplay

Guess the number: 50

Lower number please

Guess the number: 25

Higher number please

Guess the number: 30

You have guessed the number 30 correctly in 3 attempts
